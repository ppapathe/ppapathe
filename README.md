Welcome to my GitHub! I am a Senior IT Infrastructure Engineer with over 15 years of experience in managing complex systems, 
automating infrastructure, and driving innovation across various technology stacks. My expertise spans cloud platforms (AWS, Oracle), 
containerization (Docker), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and database management (Oracle, MySQL, Postgres).

On this GitHub, you'll find repositories showcasing my work with Terraform scripts for cloud infrastructure automation, Docker containers 
for application deployment, and various tools for system monitoring and optimization. I am particularly passionate about creating efficient, 
secure, and scalable infrastructures, and I continuously seek opportunities to learn and implement new technologies in my projects.

Feel free to explore my contributions and check out my open-source projects. 
I’m always open to collaboration, feedback, and discussions around improving infrastructure and IT operations.
